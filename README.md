# SIDEA: "A Sexually Intercourse Diseases Education Awareness using Data Analysis"

## Abstract
One of the world's fastest-growing epidemics is occurring in the Philippines. Public health policies that are based on scientific evidence are required. Researchers evaluated published studies on the percentages of infected by area, by year, by age, and most infected by gender and the current available treatment hub in the country year 2021 from the HIV/AIDS and ART Registry of the Philippines from 2015 to 2021 to explain data analysis of the public health literature on HIV risk groups and prevention techniques.

## Introduction
In Asia and the Pacific, the Philippines has the fastest-growing HIV epidemic. HIV prevalence in the Philippines climbed by 207 percent between 2010 and 2019, according to UNAIDS data. In the same time span, AIDS-related mortality increased by 338 percent. In the Philippines, an estimated 97,000 people were living with HIV in 2019. Seventy-three percent were aware of their HIV status, and 44 percent were on antiretroviral therapy. HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that affects cells in the body that help it fight infections, making a person more susceptible to other infections and diseases. Contact with certain bodily fluids of an HIV-positive individual, most commonly during unprotected intercourse (sex without the use of a condom or HIV treatment to prevent or treat HIV), or sharing injection drug equipment spreads the virus. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a virus that targets the immune system of the body. AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) can develop if HIV is not treated. There is presently no viable therapy. People who contract HIV are infected for the rest of their lives. HIV, on the other hand, can be managed with the right medical care. HIV-positive people who get proper treatment can live long, healthy lives while also protecting their relationships. There are three stages to HIV infection. It gets worse without therapy over time and eventually overwhelms the immune system. The symptoms will vary depending on which stage you are in: acute HIV infection symptoms, clinical latency symptoms, and AIDS symptoms.
HIV/AIDS is one of the world's most serious public health problems. According to the 2014 Global Statistics, 1.2 million individuals died as a result of AIDS-related illnesses, with 36.9 million people infected with HIV, with 2 million being new cases each year. To date, the worldwide response has succeeded in steadily reducing the number of People Living with HIV (PLHIV) through prevention and treatment programs for sufferers and at-risk populations. To stop the epidemic from spreading over the world, country-led frontline service delivery programs/interventions have been implemented in recent years. These programs/interventions, which focused on improving access to basic prevention, care, and treatment (PCT) services, catered to both the PLHIV community and critical populations such as male having sex with male (MSM), female having sex with male (FGM), and male having sex with female (FGM). As a response to the outbreak, each country designed its own intervention. While in Asia, Hong Kong and the Philippines have social hygiene clinics (SHC), which provide basic PCT services to critical populations, particularly for FSW, TB integration into HIV services through "one-stop shops" was proven to increase HIV screening.

**Why hiv aids education is important to the youth?**
- "HIV education can help learners not only develop and maintain safer behaviors, but also reduce stigma and discrimination towards people affected by, and living with, HIV," says UNESCO Global Coordinator for HIV and AIDS Chris Castle. Exploring the mechanisms and machinations of culture, values, beliefs, and power relationships has become more prominent, and acknowledging that education and health are inextricably linked is now seen as vital. HIV education, for example, might assist to address some of the epidemic's structural drivers, such as unfavorable gender norms, which can make women and girls more vulnerable.


## Statement of the problem
In recent years, many people have failed to grasp the dangers of sexual intercourse or any genital touching. STDs or sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as AIDS and HIV are one of the risks of having a sexual relationship. Here are some  impact of infectious diseases.
1) Some STDs/STIs go undiscovered for long periods of time. 
2) Even if there are no symptoms, the infection or disease can still be harmful and spread to our partners, thus it's crucial to be aware of it during any sexual activity. 
3) We can catch any disease or infection, including AIDS/HIV, regardless of our marital status. 
4) Many people are unaware of the fact that this type of disease or infection is often characterized by being symptomatic. 
5) Infected persons will not display any symptoms, therefore you won't realize that you have STIs/STDs until they have spread or caused other side effects. 
6) People are also unaware that symptoms might occur in a matter of days or weeks, but sometimes they also take months or even years to develop. 
7) Based on the number of population year 2019 increase the percentage of infected than last years, and got decrease by year of 2020. And because of COVID-19 pandemic it still increase the number of infected.

## Significance of the Study
The proposed overall project goal is to provide an explanatory data analysis about the awareness education of HIV/AIDS in the Philippines.  Having this kind of data sets have it's own advantage,

- To review the situation regard the HIV/AIDS in the Philippines.
- To monitor the information about the  facilities center available in the country.
- To create a data sets which lead to greater understanding the causes and effects of HIV/AIDS.
- To proposed an explanatory data about the stages of Symptoms.
- To provide what are the possible preventions.
- To provide the total population infected in the Philippines.
- To provide the means to examine the numbers of people who got infected. 
- To provide a datasets what ages has the most infected.
- To provide a datasets what gender has the most infected.
- To provide a datasets about regions percentage of infected.
- The significance of knowing about HIV/AIDS and assisting our community in the AIDS battle.
- Lower the number of new HIV infections (particularly among teenagers) and
- Lessen the effects of HIV/AIDS on individuals, families, and communities

## This study will be beneficial for,
- For filipino citizens, project will be having an advantage to monitor  what gender and age has the most number of HIV/AIDS infected. And having knowledge the factors of HIV/AIDS.
- For students, who will require the information for future projects. This will aid them in developing a thorough grasp about the importance of  having advance  knowledge regards the HIV/AIDS. 
- Future Researchers, this repository will serve as a guide for future researchers interested in doing a study comparable to this one. Future researchers are allowed to improve on these projects and utilize them as a reference.
- For HIV/AIDS patient, This study will help them to monitor the available facility prevention center in their place. 
## Methods
Data have been collected via using a mixed method of qualitative and quantitative methods. It was utilized to identify the factors that have affected HIV/AIDS testing among the individuals in recent years. A descriptive cross-sectional study was used in the quantitative strand of the study to determine the important and context-specific factors that influenced HIV/AIDS testing among Filipinos. A convenience sampling technique was used to select the subjects. We're also considering utilizing a self-completed online questionnaire to provide us greater flexibility in data collection for further study in the near future. The questionnaire asked about how and when they contracted the diseases, as well as any HIV/AIDS-related knowledge. It also asked if they were aware of the danger of contracting STIs during sexual contact. In terms of the qualitative component of the study, we planned to employ semi-structured interviews to capture the viewpoints of healthcare professionals working in the HIV/AIDS area in the Philippines. In data gathering, we conduct Exploratory Data Analysis, or EDA, as a means of analyzing datasets in order to summarize the major aspects of any visual methods.

## Expected Output

The main purpose of this research is to conduct an explanatory data analysis to determine the impact of Sexually Intercourse Disease Education and Awareness in the year 2015-2021, as well as other sexually transmitted illnesses and their effects on human health in 2015 to 2021. By creating an explanatory data analysis for this study, the researchers would be able to find solutions to avoid sexually transmitted diseases and infection in the Philippines. Educators will be one of the most influential people in this project since they provide an authoritative explanation of what sexually intercourse is and what elements and consequences it has on human health. Also with help of our data analysis it help people understand what part of the location HIV/AIDS is mostly common and set it help people understand how fast the virus grow on human health and how easily the virus can be contacted. Reducing the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS and give care and support to those living with the disease and their families is one of our priorities and goals. These kind goals may will take years to achieve, and we won't be able to accomplish them in a few months but with a lot of publicity to spread this kind of data or information and little follow-up we can alarm a lot of people of how important is this. Organizations may also help us and they must work on a long-term campaign on a continuous basis. We expect that people should be educated and learned on how to avoid contracting HIV/AIDS by modifying their sexual habits. Also developing a community which cares for this kind of projects to help individuals living with STIs and STIs orphans to raise awareness about the disease and make communities more accepting of persons living with any STIs as equal.

**Recommnedations**
- Create tools to help persons living with AIDS enforce their rights.
- Ensure that those living with AIDS have their rights safeguarded.
- Promote an open and accepting culture surrounding HIV/AIDS and other STDs.
- A public awareness campaign to inspire openness and influence behavior change;
- Enhance AIDS treatment for persons living with the disease.
- Increase the number of people who can get HIV testing and counseling on a voluntary basis;
- Encourage people to use condoms more often in order to limit the spread of STDs and HIV infections;
