# SIDEA: "A Sexually Intercourse Diseases Education Awareness using Data Analysis"
## Introduction

**What is HIV/AIDS?**

HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that damages the cells in your immune system and weakens your ability to fight everyday infections and disease. AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) is the name used to describe a number of potentially life-threatening infections and illnesses that happen when your immune system has been severely damaged by the HIV virus.

**How do you get AIDS**

ways to get AIDS: unprotected sex, contact with infected blood or body fluids and mother to baby transmission.

**Unprotected sex:**
This is the most common way that people get AIDS. If you have sex with an HIV positive person and there is direct contact between, you can easily get infected.
 
**Contact with infected blood.**
If you have an open wound and it comes into contact with the blood of an HIV positive person, you can get infected. This contact could be through using the same needles for drugs or unsafe instruments used for circumcision. You can also get it from blood transfusions if the blood is contaminated [in SA all blood is screened]. Medical workers can get it from accidentally pricking themselves with needles they have used to inject HIV positive people.
 
**Mother to baby transmission.**
HIV positive mothers can pass the infection to their babies, although this does not happen in all cases. Transmission can happen during pregnancy, or childbirth because of the contact with blood, or during breast feeding.
You cannot get AIDS from kissing someone on the lips, hugging, sharing food and drink or using the same bath or toilet as someone who is HIV positive.

Anyone can get AIDS, but some people are more vulnerable because they do not have the power to say no to unprotected sex or because of their risky lifestyles. The groups who are most vulnerable and have the highest infection rates are:

- Young women between 15 - 30 years old
- Sexually active men who have more than one partner, with young men more common
- Migrant and mine workers
- Transport workers
- Sex workers
- Drug users who use needles


**What are the stages of HIV?**

**Stage 1: Acute HIV Infection**
People have a large amount of HIV in their blood. They are very contagious.
Some people have flu-like symptoms. This is the body’s natural response to infection.
But some people may not feel sick right away or at all.
If you have flu-like symptoms and think you may have been exposed to HIV, seek medical care and ask for a test to diagnose acute infection.
Only antigen/antibody tests or nucleic acid tests (NATs) can diagnose acute infection.

**Stage 2: Chronic HIV Infection**
This stage is also called asymptomatic HIV infection or clinical latency.
HIV is still active but reproduces at very low levels.
People may not have any symptoms or get sick during this phase.
Without taking HIV medicine, this period may last a decade or longer, but some may progress faster.
People can transmit HIV in this phase.
At the end of this phase, the amount of HIV in the blood (called viral load) goes up and the CD4 cell count goes down. The person may have symptoms as the virus levels increase in the body, and the person moves into Stage 3.
People who take HIV medicine as prescribed may never move into Stage 3.

**Stage 3: Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS)**
The most severe phase of HIV infection.
People with AIDS have such badly damaged immune systems that they get an increasing number of severe illnesses, called opportunistic infections.
People receive an AIDS diagnosis when their CD4 cell count drops below 200 cells/mm, or if they develop certain opportunistic infections.
People with AIDS can have a high viral load and be very infectious.
Without treatment, people with AIDS typically survive about three years.


**Why hiv aids education is important to the youth?**
- According to UNESCO Global Coordinator for HIV and AIDS Chris Castle, “HIV education can help learners to not only develop and maintain safer behaviours, but also reduce stigma and discrimination towards people affected by, and living with, HIV.”
Exploring the mechanisms and machinations of culture, values, beliefs and relationships of power has become more prominent and acknowledging that education and health are inextricably linked is now seen as vital. For example, HIV education can help to tackle some of the structural drivers of the epidemic, such as harmful gender norms, which can increase the vulnerability of women and girls.


## Statement of the problem
In recent years, many people have failed to grasp the dangers of sexual intercourse or any genital touching. STDs or sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as AIDS and HIV are one of the risks of having a sexual relationship. Some STDs/STIs go undiscovered for long periods of time. Even if there are no symptoms, the infection or disease can still be harmful and spread to our partners, thus it's crucial to be aware of it during any sexual activity. We can catch any disease or infection, including AIDS/HIV, regardless of our marital status. Many people are unaware of the fact that this type of disease or infection is often characterized by being symptomatic. Infected persons will not display any symptoms, therefore you won't realize that you have STIs/STDs until they have spread or caused other side effects. People are also unaware that symptoms might occur in a matter of days or weeks, but sometimes they also take months or even years to develop.

## Significance of the Study
The proposed overall project goal is to provide an explanatory data analysis about the awareness education of HIV/AIDS in the Philippines.  Having this kind of data sets have it's own advantage,

- To review the situation regard the HIV/AIDS in the Philippines.
- To monitor the information about the  facilities center available in the country.
- To create a data sets which lead to greater understanding the causes and effects of HIV/AIDS.
- To proposed an explanatory data about the stages of Symptoms.
- To provide what are the possible preventions.
- To provide the total population infected in the Philippines.
- To provide the means to examine the numbers of people who got infected. 
- To provide a datasets what ages has the most infected.
- To provide a datasets what gender has the most infected.
- Importance of learning information about HIV AIDS by helping our community through the campaign against AIDS.
- Reduce the number of new HIV infections (especially among youth) and
- Reduce the impact of HIV and AIDS on individuals, families and communities
- 
## This study will be beneficial for,
- For filipino citizens, project will be having an advantage to monitor  what gender and age has the most number of HIV/AIDS infected. And having knowledge the factors of HIV/AIDS.
- For students, who will require the information for future projects. This will aid them in developing a thorough grasp about the importance of  having advance  knowledge regards the HIV/AIDS. 
- Future Researchers, this repository will serve as a guide for future researchers interested in doing a study comparable to this one. Future researchers are allowed to improve on these projects and utilize them as a reference.
- For HIV/AIDS patient, This study will help them to monitor the available facility prevention center in their place. 
## Methods
Data have been collected via using a mixed method of qualitative and quantitative methods. It was utilized to identify the factors that have affected HIV/AIDS testing among the individuals in recent years. A descriptive cross-sectional study was used in the quantitative strand of the study to determine the important and context-specific factors that influenced HIV/AIDS testing among Filipinos. A convenience sampling technique was used to select the subjects. We're also considering utilizing a self-completed online questionnaire to provide us greater flexibility in data collection for further study in the near future. The questionnaire asked about how and when they contracted the diseases, as well as any HIV/AIDS-related knowledge. It also asked if they were aware of the danger of contracting STIs during sexual contact. In terms of the qualitative component of the study, we planned to employ semi-structured interviews to capture the viewpoints of healthcare professionals working in the HIV/AIDS area in the Philippines. In data gathering, we conduct Exploratory Data Analysis, or EDA, as a means of analyzing datasets in order to summarize the major aspects of any visual methods.

## Expected Output

The main purpose of this research is to conduct an explanatory data analysis to determine the impact of Sexually Intercourse Disease Education and Awareness in the year 2020-2021, as well as other sexually transmitted illnesses and their effects on human health in 2014 to 2021. By creating an explanatory data analysis for this study, the researchers would be able to find solutions to avoid sexually transmitted diseases and infection in the Philippines. Educators will be one of the most influential people in this project since they provide an authoritative explanation of what sexually intercourse is and what elements and consequences it has on human health. Also with help of our data analysis it help people understand what part of the location HIV/AIDS is mostly common and set it help people understand how fast the virus grow on human health and how easily the virus can be contacted. Reducing the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS and give care and support to those living with the disease and their families is one of our priorities and goals. These kind goals may will take years to achieve, and we won't be able to accomplish them in a few months but with a lot of publicity to spread this kind of data or information and little follow-up we can alarm a lot of people of how important is this. Organizations may also help us and they must work on a long-term campaign on a continuous basis. We expect that people should be educated and learned on how to avoid contracting HIV/AIDS by modifying their sexual habits. Also developing a community which cares for this kind of projects to help individuals living with STIs and STIs orphans to raise awareness about the disease and make communities more accepting of persons living with any STIs as equal.

**Recommnedations **
- Create a culture of openness and acceptance around HIV and AIDS and STDs
- Ensure that the rights of people living with AIDS are protected.
- Develop mechanisms to assist people living with AIDS to enforce their rights.
- A public awareness drive to influence behaviour change and encourage openness;
- Increase access to voluntary HIV testing and counselling;
- Promote increased condom use to reduce the spread of STD and HIV infections;
- Improve the treatment of people living with AIDS
