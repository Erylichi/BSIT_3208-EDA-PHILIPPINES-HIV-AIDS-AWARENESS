# SIDEA: "A Sexually Intercourse Diseases Education Awareness for the people with the help of Data Analysis"
## Introduction
The HIV epidemic in the Philippines is the fastest-growing in the Asia and Pacific region. According to UNAIDS data, HIV prevalence in the Philippines increased by 207% from 2010 to 2019. AIDS-related deaths rose by 338% in the same period. In 2019, an estimated 97,000 people were living with HIV in the Philippines. Of those, 73% knew their status and 44% were receiving antiretroviral treatment. HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that attacks cells that help the body fight infection, making a person more vulnerable to other infections and diseases. It is spread by contact with certain bodily fluids of a person with HIV, most commonly during unprotected sex (sex without a condom or HIV medicine to prevent or treat HIV), or through sharing injection drug equipment.HIV can be transmitted via the exchange of a variety of body fluids from infected people, such as blood, breast milk, semen and vaginal secretions. HIV can also be transmitted from a mother to her child during pregnancy and delivery. Individuals cannot become infected through ordinary day-to-day contact such as kissing, hugging, shaking hands, or sharing personal objects, food or water. It is important to note that people with HIV who are taking ART and are virally suppressed do not transmit HIV to their sexual partners.  Early access to ART and support to remain on treatment is therefore critical not only to improve the health of people with HIV but also to prevent HIV transmission.  Behaviors and conditions that put individuals at greater risk of contracting HIV include:having unprotected anal or vaginal sex, having another sexually transmitted infection (STI) such as syphilis, herpes, chlamydia, gonorrhoea and bacterial vaginosis, sharing contaminated needles, syringes and other injecting equipment and drug solutions when injecting drugs, receiving unsafe injections, blood transfusions and tissue transplantation, and medical procedures that involve unsterile cutting or piercing and
experiencing accidental needle stick injuries, including among health workers. HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that attacks the body’s immune system, if HIV is not treated, it can lead to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome).There is currently no effective cure. Once people get HIV, they have it for life, but with proper medical care, HIV can be controlled. People with HIV who get effective HIV treatment can live long, healthy lives and protect their partners. HIV infection happens in three stages, without treatment, it gets worse over time and eventually overpowers the immune system.The symptoms of HIV vary depending on the stage of infection. Though people living with HIV tend to be most infectious in the first few months after being infected, many are unaware of their status until the later stages. In the first few weeks after initial infection people may experience no symptoms or an influenza-like illness including fever, headache, rash or sore throat.As the infection progressively weakens the immune system, they can develop other signs and symptoms, such as swollen lymph nodes, weight loss, fever, diarrhoea and cough. Without treatment, they could also develop severe illnesses such as tuberculosis (TB), cryptococcal meningitis, severe bacterial infections, and cancers such as lymphomas and Kaposi's sarcoma.

HIV/AIDS is one of the gravest public health issues in the world. According to the 2014 Global Statistics, 1.2 million people died of AIDS-related illnesses, with about 36.9 million people infected with HIV, of which 2 million accounts for the annual newly-infected cases. The global response to date, through the prevention and treatment services for sufferers and population at risk, has succeeded in decreasing the number of People Living with HIV (PLHIV) steadily . In recent years, country-led frontline service delivery programs/interventions have been carried out to halt the epidemic across the globe. These programs/interventions, focusing on better access to basic prevention, care and treatment (PCT) services, have catered to both the PLHIV population and key populations such as, male having sex with male (MSM), female sex workers (FSW) and people who inject drugs (PWID). Each country devised their own intervention as a response to the epidemic. In Ghana, TB integration into the HIV services through “one-stop shops” were found to have improved HIV screening.While in Asia, Hong Kong and the Philippines have social hygiene clinics (SHC), which provide basic PCT services to key populations, particularly for FSW.
