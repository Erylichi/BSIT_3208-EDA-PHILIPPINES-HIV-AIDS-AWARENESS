# SIDEA: "A Sexually Intercourse Diseases Education Awareness using Data Analysis"
The datasets used in this repository are from HIV-AIDS registry of the Philippines.
 
## Introduction

 The Philippines has the fastest-growing HIV pandemic in Asia and the Pacific. According to UNAIDS figures, HIV prevalence in the Philippines increased by 207 percent between 2010 and 2019. AIDS-related mortality climbed by 338 percent within the same time period. In 2019, an estimated 97,000 persons in the Philippines were living with HIV. Seventy-three percent knew they had HIV, and 44 percent were taking antiretroviral medication. HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that damages cells that help the body fight infections, leaving a person more susceptible to other infections and illnesses. Contact with an HIV-positive person's body fluids, most often during unprotected intercourse (sexual activity without the use of a condom or HIV therapy to prevent or treat HIV) or sharing injectable drug equipment, distributes the virus. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a virus that attacks the body's immune system. If HIV is not treated, AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) can develop. There is currently no effective treatment. HIV infected people are infected for the remainder of their life. HIV, on the other hand, may be controlled with proper medical treatment. HIV-positive persons who get effective treatment can live long, healthy lives while maintaining their relationships. HIV infection is divided into three phases. Without treatment, it worsens over time, eventually overwhelming the immune system. Depending on whether you are experiencing acute HIV infection symptoms, clinical latency symptoms, or AIDS symptoms, your symptoms will differ. One of the world's most critical public health issues is HIV/AIDS. According to the 2014 Global Statistics, 1.2 million people died from AIDS-related diseases in 2014, with 36.9 million people infected with HIV and 2 million new cases per year. To far, the global response has been successful in progressively lowering the number of people living with HIV (PLHIV) through preventive and treatment programs for those who are infected and those who are at risk. In recent years, country-led frontline service delivery programs/interventions have been created to halt the pandemic from spreading over the world. These programs/interventions aimed to increase access to basic HIV prevention, care, and treatment (PCT) services for both the PLHIV community and vulnerable groups such as males having sex with males (MSM), females having sex with males (FGM), and males having sex with a female (MGF). Each country devised its own plan to combat the pandemic. While Hong Kong and the Philippines offer social hygiene clinics (SHC) that provide basic PCT treatments to vulnerable groups, including as FSW, TB integration with HIV care through "one-stop shopping" has been shown to boost HIV screening rates.

## Statement of the problem

 The primary issue that this research would address is that many people have failed to recognize the dangers of sexual intercourse or any genital touches in recent years. One of the dangers of having a sexual connection is STDs, or sexually transmitted illnesses (STIs), such as AIDS and HIV. The majority of patients are unaware of the danger it poses to their life. The percentage of patients with HIV/AIDS are males, and the disease is transmitted through sexual contact. The majority of the patients are between the ages of 25 and 34. People should be aware of this case for the reason they will be learned alot and educate how to lessen and abstain HIV/aids.In addition to representing a staggering public health crisis, HIV/AIDS is also fundamentally a human rights issue. Many factors drive the spread of the disease, such as poverty, homelessness, illiteracy, prostitution, human trafficking, drug (substance) abuse, stigma, discrimination and gender-based inequality.

## Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

The Project's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
Sustainable Poverty Action and Ensure Healthy Lives Action are the SDGs that this project aims to achieve. The following are additional descriptions of the SDGs:

## Goal 1: eradicate poverty
Poverty can make people more vulnerable to HIV infection. Women's socioeconomic status has an impact on their ability to prevent or mitigate the effects of HIV. HIV-affected households are more likely to fall into and remain in poverty. Economic empowerment and social protection can help reduce poverty and HIV vulnerability while also keeping HIV patients healthy.
## Goal 3: Ensure that people live healthy lives.
Access to HIV prevention and treatment is hampered by a lack of universal health coverage, which includes sexual and reproductive health services as well as harm reduction for people who inject drugs. The majority of people who become infected with HIV do so through sexual transmission or transmission from mother to infant during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding. Integrating HIV-sensitive universal health coverage with rights-based services for sexual and reproductive health, noncommunicable diseases, hepatitis, tuberculosis, and other conditions can improve broader health outcomes. SDG 3 includes Member States' commitment to eradicate AIDS by 2030. (target 3.3).
This framework will assist the Philippine government in taking immediate action prior to a larger number of people contracting/ having HIV/AIDS.

## Significance of the Study

 The proposed overall project goal is to provide an explanatory data analysis about the awareness education of HIV/AIDS in the Philippines.  Having this kind of data sets have it's own advantage,

- To review the situation regard the HIV/AIDS in the Philippines.
- To monitor the information about the  facilities center available in the country.
- To create a data sets which lead to greater understanding the causes and effects of HIV/AIDS.
- To provide the means to examine the numbers of people who got infected by 2015-2021. 
- To provide a datasets what ages has the most infected.
- To provide a datasets what gender has the most infected.
- To provide a datasets about regions percentage of infected.
- Lower the number of new HIV infections (particularly among teenagers) by creating a recommendations how to prevent the number of infected.

## This study will be beneficial for: 

- The initiative will benefit Filipino residents by allowing them to track which gender and age group has the highest number of HIV/AIDS affected people. Also, being aware of the HIV/AIDS risk factors.
- For students who will need the knowledge in the future for their projects. This will help students have a better understanding of the need of being well-informed about HIV/AIDS.
- Future Researchers will be able to use this repository as a reference if they want to conduct a study similar to this one. Future scholars are free to build on these initiatives and use them as a model.
- This study will assist HIV/AIDS patients in monitoring the available HIV/AIDS preventive facilities in their area.

## Methods

 Data have been collected via using a mixed method of qualitative and quantitative methods. It was utilized to identify the factors that have affected HIV/AIDS testing among the individuals in recent years. A descriptive cross-sectional study was used in the quantitative strand of the study to determine the important and context-specific factors that influenced HIV/AIDS testing among Filipinos. A convenience sampling technique was used to select the subjects. We're also considering utilizing a self-completed online questionnaire to provide us greater flexibility in data collection for further study in the near future. The questionnaire asked about how and when they contracted the diseases, as well as any HIV/AIDS-related knowledge. It also asked if they were aware of the danger of contracting STIs during sexual contact. In terms of the qualitative component of the study, we planned to employ semi-structured interviews to capture the viewpoints of healthcare professionals working in the HIV/AIDS area in the Philippines. In data gathering, we conduct Exploratory Data Analysis, or EDA, as a means of analyzing datasets in order to summarize the major aspects of any visual methods.

## Expected Output

The purpose of this study is to conduct an explanatory data analysis to estimate the impact of sexually transmitted disease education and awareness from 2015 to 2021. By conducting an explanatory data analysis, the researchers will be able to develop methods to prevent sexually transmitted illnesses and infection in the Philippines. Educators will be one of the most important people in this effort because they will provide a credible explanation of what sexual intercourse is and the effects it has on human health.Individuals can also use our data analysis to learn which parts of the country are the most affected by HIV/AIDS, as well as how quickly the virus spreads and how easy it is to get the disease. Reduce the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS and give care and support to individuals living with the disease and their families is one of our main goals. These kinds of objectives may take years to achieve, and we won't be able to do so in a few months, but with a lot of exposure and minimum follow-up, we can alert a large number of individuals to the importance of this. Organizations can also help us, but they must do it as part of a long-term campaign. People should be taught and informed on how to prevent catching HIV/AIDS by changing their sexual behaviors, according to our expectations. Creating a community that cares about such programs to assist people living with STIs and STI orphans, as well as raising knowledge about the disease and making communities more accepting of people living with any STI.

**Recommnendations to prevent or lessen the number of population of having HIV/AIDS**
- Create tools to assist people living with HIV/AIDS in asserting their rights.
- Ensure that the rights of those living with AIDS are protected.
- Encourage people to be open and accepting of HIV/AIDS and other STDs.
- A Barangay public awareness campaign to encourage transparency and change behavior.
- Increase the number of persons who can receive free HIV testing and counseling;
- Encourage people to use condoms more frequently to prevent the spread of STDs and HIV;
- Innovation : HIV/AIDS Information System. (Plase see attach our ppt presentation)
