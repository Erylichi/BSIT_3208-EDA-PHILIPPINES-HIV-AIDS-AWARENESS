# Explanatory Data Analysis: Philippines HIV/AIDS Awareness
## Introduction
The HIV epidemic in the Philippines is the fastest-growing in the Asia and Pacific region. According to UNAIDS data, HIV prevalence in the Philippines increased by 207% from 2010 to 2019. AIDS-related deaths rose by 338% in the same period. In 2019, an estimated 97,000 people were living with HIV in the Philippines. Of those, 73% knew their status and 44% were receiving antiretroviral treatment. HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that attacks cells that help the body fight infection, making a person more vulnerable to other infections and diseases. It is spread by contact with certain bodily fluids of a person with HIV, most commonly during unprotected sex (sex without a condom or HIV medicine to prevent or treat HIV), or through sharing injection drug equipment. HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that attacks the body’s immune system, if HIV is not treated, it can lead to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome).There is currently no effective cure. Once people get HIV, they have it for life, but with proper medical care, HIV can be controlled. People with HIV who get effective HIV treatment can live long, healthy lives and protect their partners. HIV infection happens in three stages, without treatment, it gets worse over time and eventually overpowers the immune system. The symptoms will depend on every stage: first stage: Acute HIV infection symptoms, second stage: clinical latency symptoms and third stage: AIDS symptoms.
