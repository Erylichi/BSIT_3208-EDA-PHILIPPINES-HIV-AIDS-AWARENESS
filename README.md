# SIDEA: "A Sexually Intercourse Diseases Education Awareness using Data Analysis"
The datasets used in this repository are from HIV-AIDS registry of the Philippines year 2015 to 2021.
 
## Introduction

 The Philippines has the fastest developing HIV pandemic in Asia and in the Pacific. As per UNAIDS figures, HIV commonness in the Philippines expanded by 207% somewhere in the range of 2010 and 2019. Helps related mortality moved by 338% inside a similar time span. In 2019, an expected 97,000 people in the Philippines were living with HIV. 73% realized they had HIV, and 44 percent were taking antiretroviral medicine. HIV (human immunodeficiency viruses) is an infection that harms cells that assist the body with battling contaminations, leaving an individual more defenseless to different diseases and sicknesses. Contact with a HIV-positive individual's body liquids, most frequently during unprotected intercourse (sexual action without the utilization of a condom or HIV treatment to forestall or treat HIV) or sharing injectable medication gear, disperses the infection. Human immunodeficiency infection (HIV) is an infection that goes after the body's safe framework. On the off chance that HIV isn't dealt with, Helps (AIDS) can create. There is right now no viable treatment. HIV contaminated individuals are tainted until the end of their life. HIV, then again, might be controlled with appropriate clinical treatment. HIV-positive people who seek compelling treatment can live lengthy, sound lives while keeping up with their connections. HIV contamination is separated into three stages. Without treatment, it demolishes over the long run, ultimately overpowering the safe framework. Contingent upon whether you are encountering intense HIV contamination side effects, clinical idleness side effects, or Helps side effects, your side effects will contrast. One of the world's most basic general medical problems is HIV/AIDS. As per the 2014 Worldwide Measurements, 1.2 million individuals passed on from AIDS related sicknesses in 2014, with 36.9 million individuals tainted with HIV and 2 million new cases each year. To far, the worldwide reaction has been effective in continuously bringing down the quantity of individuals living with HIV (PLHIV) through preventive and treatment programs for the people who are tainted and the individuals who are in danger. Lately, country-drove forefront administration conveyance programs/intercessions have been made to stop the pandemic from spreading over the world. These projects/mediations intended to build admittance to essential HIV counteraction, care, and treatment administrations for both the PLHIV people group and weak gatherings, for example, Men having intercourse with men (MSM), females having intercourse with men (FGM), and guys engaging in sexual relations with a female (MGF). Every nation conceived its own arrangement to battle the pandemic. While Hong Kong and the Philippines offer social cleanliness facilities (SHC) that give fundamental PCT medicines to weak gatherings, including as FSW, TB coordination with HIV care through "one-quit shopping" has been displayed to support HIV screening rates.

## Statement of the problem

 The primary issue that this research would address is that many people have failed to recognize the dangers of sexual intercourse or any genital touches in recent years. One of the dangers of having a sexual connection is STDs, or sexually transmitted illnesses (STIs), such as AIDS and HIV. The majority of patients are unaware of the danger it poses to their life. The percentage of patients with HIV/AIDS are males, and the disease is transmitted through sexual contact. The majority of the patients are between the ages of 25 and 34. People should be aware of this case for the reason they will be learned alot and educate how to lessen and abstain HIV/aids. HIV/Aids have many factors drive the spread of the disease, such as poverty, homelessness, illiteracy, prostitution, human trafficking, abuse,discrimination and gender-based inequality. Also in another thing is most people dont get serious to know how really important to be aware of having HIV, Many people have no idea about the learning on how to abstain and prevent it, so that's why the level of percentage that have an HIV is continually increase. Everyone should be educated to lessen the value of this case to the people. If they learn and if they educate it must be a high possible to have decrease number of a having an HIV.

## Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

The Project's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
Sustainable Poverty Action and Ensure Healthy Lives Action are the SDGs that this project aims to achieve. The following are additional descriptions of the SDGs:

## Goal 1: No Poverty
Poverty can make people more vulnerable to HIV infection. Women's socioeconomic status has an impact on their ability to prevent or mitigate the effects of HIV. HIV-affected households are more likely to fall into and remain in poverty. Economic empowerment and social protection can help reduce poverty and HIV vulnerability while also keeping HIV patients healthy.
## Goal 3: Good health and well being.
Access to HIV prevention and treatment is hampered by a lack of universal health coverage, which includes sexual and reproductive health services as well as harm reduction for people who inject drugs. The majority of people who become infected with HIV do so through sexual transmission or transmission from mother to infant during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding. Integrating HIV-sensitive universal health coverage with rights-based services for sexual and reproductive health, noncommunicable diseases, hepatitis, tuberculosis, and other conditions can improve broader health outcomes. SDG 3 includes Member States' commitment to eradicate AIDS by 2030. (target 3.3).
This framework will assist the Philippine government in taking immediate action prior to a larger number of people contracting/ having HIV/AIDS.

## Significance of the Study

 The proposed overall project goal is to provide an explanatory data analysis about the awareness education of HIV/AIDS in the Philippines.  Having this kind of data sets have it's own advantage,

- To review the situation regard the HIV/AIDS in the Philippines.
- To monitor the information about the  facilities center available in the country.
- To create a data sets which lead to greater understanding the causes and effects of HIV/AIDS.
- To provide the means to examine the numbers of people who got infected by 2015-2021. 
- To provide a datasets what ages has the most infected.
- To provide a datasets what gender has the most infected.
- To provide a datasets about regions percentage of infected.
- To Lower the number of new HIV infections particularly among teenagers by creating a recommendations how to prevent the number of infected.
- To effectively engage those most at risk of HIV into the prevention.
- To improve HIV care and efficiency through different health care procedure and learning ideas to prevent the HIV cases.

## This study will be beneficial for: 

- The initiative will benefit Filipino residents by allowing them to track which gender and age group has the highest number of HIV/AIDS affected people. Also, being aware of the HIV/AIDS risk factors.
- For students who will need the knowledge in the future for their projects. This will help students have a better understanding of the need of being well-informed about HIV/AIDS.
- Future Researchers will be able to use this repository as a reference if they want to conduct a study similar to this one. Future scholars are free to build on these initiatives and use them as a model. The future Researchers can use this as reference if they have plan to do related studies precisely an standard underlying Bachelor of Science in Information Technology 
- This study will assist HIV/AIDS patients in monitoring the available HIV/AIDS preventive facilities in their area.
- For every Man and Woman who undergo sexual contact and have no idea on this learning for them to educate and must be aware how harmful to have this kind of illness  and also the importance to educate everyone who truly wants to learn this.
- For those people who involve and have an HIV cases.

## Methods

 The Data have been collected via using a method of quantitative methods. It was utilized to identify the factors that have affected HIV/AIDS testing among the individuals in recent years. A descriptive cross-sectional study was used in the quantitative strand of the study to determine the important and context-specific factors that influenced HIV/AIDS testing among Filipinos. A convenience sampling technique was used to select the subjects. In data gathering, we conduct Exploratory Data Analysis, or EDA, as a means of analyzing datasets in order to summarize the major aspects of any visual methods.

## Expected Output

The purpose of this study is to conduct an explanatory data analysis to estimate the impact of sexually transmitted disease education and awareness from 2015 to 2021. By conducting an explanatory data analysis, the researchers will be able to develop methods to prevent sexually transmitted illnesses and infection in the Philippines. Educators will be one of the most important people in this effort because they will provide a credible explanation of what sexual intercourse is and the effects it has on human health.Individuals can also use our data analysis to learn which parts of the country are the most affected by HIV/AIDS, as well as how quickly the virus spreads and how easy it is to get the disease. Reduce the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS and give care and support to individuals living with the disease and their families is one of our main goals. These kinds of objectives may take years to achieve, and we won't be able to do so in a few months, but with a lot of exposure and minimum follow-up, we can alert a large number of individuals to the importance of this. Organizations can also help us, but they must do it as part of a long-term campaign. People should be taught and informed on how to prevent catching HIV/AIDS by changing their sexual behaviors, according to our expectations. Creating a community that cares about such programs to assist people living with STIs and STI orphans, as well as raising knowledge about the disease and making communities more accepting of people living with any STI.

**Recommnendations to prevent or lessen the number of population of having HIV/AIDS**
- Create tools to assist people living with HIV/AIDS in asserting their rights.
- Ensure that the rights of those living with AIDS are protected.
- Encourage people to be open and accepting of HIV/AIDS and other STDs.
- A Barangay public awareness campaign to encourage transparency and change behavior.
- Increase the number of persons who can receive free HIV testing and counseling;
- Encourage people to use condoms more frequently to prevent the spread of STDs and HIV;
- Innovation : HIV/AIDS Information System. (Plase see attach our ppt presentation)
- Using strategies to educate the people which can prevent HIV/Aids for not having sex, and using condoms the right way every time you have sex. 
- Learning about educational sex and the used of condoms that helps prevent HIV for higher risk sexual activities like anal or vaginal sex.
