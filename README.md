# SIDEA: "A Sexually Intercourse Diseases Education Awareness using Data Analysis"
 
## Abstract

 One of the world's fastest-growing epidemics is occurring in the Philippines. Public health policies that are based on scientific evidence are required. Researchers evaluated published studies on the percentages of infected by area, by year, by age, and most infected by gender and the current available treatment hub in the country year 2021 from the HIV/AIDS and ART Registry of the Philippines from 2015 to 2021 to explain data analysis of the public health literature on HIV risk groups and prevention techniques.

## Introduction

 The Philippines has the fastest-growing HIV pandemic in Asia and the Pacific. According to UNAIDS figures, HIV prevalence in the Philippines increased by 207 percent between 2010 and 2019. AIDS-related mortality climbed by 338 percent within the same time period. In 2019, an estimated 97,000 persons in the Philippines were living with HIV. Seventy-three percent knew they had HIV, and 44 percent were taking antiretroviral medication. HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that damages cells that help the body fight infections, leaving a person more susceptible to other infections and illnesses. Contact with an HIV-positive person's body fluids, most often during unprotected intercourse (sexual activity without the use of a condom or HIV therapy to prevent or treat HIV) or sharing injectable drug equipment, distributes the virus. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a virus that attacks the body's immune system. If HIV is not treated, AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) can develop. There is currently no effective treatment. HIV infected people are infected for the remainder of their life. HIV, on the other hand, may be controlled with proper medical treatment. HIV-positive persons who get effective treatment can live long, healthy lives while maintaining their relationships. HIV infection is divided into three phases. Without treatment, it worsens over time, eventually overwhelming the immune system. Depending on whether you are experiencing acute HIV infection symptoms, clinical latency symptoms, or AIDS symptoms, your symptoms will differ. One of the world's most critical public health issues is HIV/AIDS. According to the 2014 Global Statistics, 1.2 million people died from AIDS-related diseases in 2014, with 36.9 million people infected with HIV and 2 million new cases per year. To far, the global response has been successful in progressively lowering the number of people living with HIV (PLHIV) through preventive and treatment programs for those who are infected and those who are at risk. In recent years, country-led frontline service delivery programs/interventions have been created to halt the pandemic from spreading over the world. These programs/interventions aimed to increase access to basic HIV prevention, care, and treatment (PCT) services for both the PLHIV community and vulnerable groups such as males having sex with males (MSM), females having sex with males (FGM), and males having sex with a female (MGF). Each country devised its own plan to combat the pandemic. While Hong Kong and the Philippines offer social hygiene clinics (SHC) that provide basic PCT treatments to vulnerable groups, including as FSW, TB integration with HIV care through "one-stop shopping" has been shown to boost HIV screening rates.

**Why hiv aids education is important to the youth?**
- "HIV education can help learners not only develop and maintain safer behaviors, but also reduce stigma and discrimination towards people affected by, and living with, HIV," says UNESCO Global Coordinator for HIV and AIDS Chris Castle. Exploring the mechanisms and machinations of culture, values, beliefs, and power relationships has become more prominent, and acknowledging that education and health are inextricably linked is now seen as vital. HIV education, for example, might assist to address some of the epidemic's structural drivers, such as unfavorable gender norms, which can make women and girls more vulnerable.


## Statement of the problem

 In recent years, many people have failed to grasp the dangers of sexual intercourse or any genital touching. STDs or sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as AIDS and HIV are one of the risks of having a sexual relationship. Here are some  impact of infectious diseases.
1) Some STDs/STIs go undiscovered for long periods of time. 
2) Even if there are no symptoms, the infection or disease can still be harmful and spread to our partners, thus it's crucial to be aware of it during any sexual activity. 
3) We can catch any disease or infection, including AIDS/HIV, regardless of our marital status. 
4) Many people are unaware of the fact that this type of disease or infection is often characterized by being symptomatic. 
5) Infected persons will not display any symptoms, therefore you won't realize that you have STIs/STDs until they have spread or caused other side effects. 
6) People are also unaware that symptoms might occur in a matter of days or weeks, but sometimes they also take months or even years to develop. 
7) Based on the number of population year 2019 increase the percentage of infected than last years, and got decrease by year of 2020. And because of COVID-19 pandemic it still increase the number of infected.

## Significance of the Study

 The proposed overall project goal is to provide an explanatory data analysis about the awareness education of HIV/AIDS in the Philippines.  Having this kind of data sets have it's own advantage,

- To review the situation regard the HIV/AIDS in the Philippines.
- To monitor the information about the  facilities center available in the country.
- To create a data sets which lead to greater understanding the causes and effects of HIV/AIDS.
- To proposed an explanatory data about the stages of Symptoms.
- To provide what are the possible preventions.
- To provide the total population infected in the Philippines.
- To provide the means to examine the numbers of people who got infected. 
- To provide a datasets what ages has the most infected.
- To provide a datasets what gender has the most infected.
- To provide a datasets about regions percentage of infected.
- The significance of knowing about HIV/AIDS and assisting our community in the AIDS battle.
- Lower the number of new HIV infections (particularly among teenagers) and
- Lessen the effects of HIV/AIDS on individuals, families, and communities

## This study will be beneficial for,

- The initiative will benefit Filipino residents by allowing them to track which gender and age group has the highest number of HIV/AIDS affected people. Also, being aware of the HIV/AIDS risk factors.
- For students who will need the knowledge in the future for their projects. This will help students have a better understanding of the need of being well-informed about HIV/AIDS.
- Future Researchers will be able to use this repository as a reference if they want to conduct a study similar to this one. Future scholars are free to build on these initiatives and use them as a model.
- This study will assist HIV/AIDS patients in monitoring the available HIV/AIDS preventive facilities in their area.

## Methods

 Data have been collected via using a mixed method of qualitative and quantitative methods. It was utilized to identify the factors that have affected HIV/AIDS testing among the individuals in recent years. A descriptive cross-sectional study was used in the quantitative strand of the study to determine the important and context-specific factors that influenced HIV/AIDS testing among Filipinos. A convenience sampling technique was used to select the subjects. We're also considering utilizing a self-completed online questionnaire to provide us greater flexibility in data collection for further study in the near future. The questionnaire asked about how and when they contracted the diseases, as well as any HIV/AIDS-related knowledge. It also asked if they were aware of the danger of contracting STIs during sexual contact. In terms of the qualitative component of the study, we planned to employ semi-structured interviews to capture the viewpoints of healthcare professionals working in the HIV/AIDS area in the Philippines. In data gathering, we conduct Exploratory Data Analysis, or EDA, as a means of analyzing datasets in order to summarize the major aspects of any visual methods.

## Expected Output

 The main objective of this study is to conduct an explanatory data analysis to estimate the impact of sexually transmitted disease education and awareness from 2015 to 2021, as well as other sexually transmitted illnesses and their consequences on human health. The researchers will be able to develop methods to prevent sexually transmitted illnesses and infection in the Philippines by doing an explanatory data analysis for this study. Educators will be one of the most significant persons in this endeavor because they will offer a credible explanation of what sexual intercourse is and what aspects and implications it has on human health. Also, with the aid of our data analysis, individuals may learn which parts of the country are the most affected by HIV/AIDS, as well as how quickly the virus spreads and how easy it can be contracted. One of our focuses and aims is to reduce the number of persons infected with HIV/AIDS and to provide care and support to those living with the disease and their families. These kinds of goals may take years to fulfill, and we won't be able to accomplish them in a few months, but with a lot of exposure and minimal follow-up, we can alert a lot of people to how essential this is. Organizations can also assist us, but they must work on a long-term campaign that is ongoing. People should be taught and informed on how to prevent catching HIV/AIDS by changing their sexual behaviors, according to our expectations. Creating a community that cares about such programs to assist people living with STIs and STI orphans, as well as raising knowledge about the disease and making communities more accepting of people living with any STI.

**Recommnedations**
- Create tools to help persons living with AIDS enforce their rights.
- Ensure that those living with AIDS have their rights safeguarded.
- Promote an open and accepting culture surrounding HIV/AIDS and other STDs.
- A public awareness campaign to inspire openness and influence behavior change;
- Enhance AIDS treatment for persons living with the disease.
- Increase the number of people who can get HIV testing and counseling on a voluntary basis;
- Encourage people to use condoms more often in order to limit the spread of STDs and HIV infections;
